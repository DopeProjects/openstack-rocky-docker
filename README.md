# openstack-rocky-docker

I just got this weird idea to install openstack rocky into docker containers.

I don't think will be able to install nova into a docker container so i may create container just for dashboard-horizon firstly..


Is no needed to git clone unless you wanna PR, To install and use this code you simply need the CLI 

**```curl -s -LA "Raws InS" "http://bit.ly/RockyCli" | bash -s```**
